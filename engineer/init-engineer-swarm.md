  checkAnnexIIICategories(system: AISystem): string[];
  calculateConfidenceScore(classification: RiskLevel): number;
  generateRationale(assessment: RiskAssessment): string;
}
```

### SoD Policy Enforcement
Implement configurable Segregation of Duties rules:
```typescript
interface SoDPolicyEngine {
  evaluatePermission(user: User, action: string, resource: Resource): SoDResult;
  checkCreatorCannotApprove(userId: string, resourceId: string): boolean;
  requireDualApproval(riskLevel: RiskLevel): boolean;
  getAlternativeApprovers(excludeUserId: string): User[];
}
```

### Audit Trail System
Generate immutable audit logs per RBAC requirements:
```typescript
interface AuditLogger {
  logAction(action: AuditAction): Promise<AuditLog>;
  verifyLogIntegrity(logId: string): Promise<boolean>;
  generateComplianceReport(timeRange: DateRange): Promise<Report>;
}
```

## Success Definition
The Engineer Swarm succeeds when we deliver a production-ready, secure, and performant backend system that:
- Enables seamless AI governance workflows
- Enforces EU AI Act compliance automatically  
- Maintains enterprise-grade security and audit capabilities
- Scales to support 10,000+ concurrent users
- Integrates flawlessly with the Designer Swarm frontend

The system should be deployment-ready with comprehensive monitoring, security hardening, and documentation that enables smooth handoff to production operations teams.
